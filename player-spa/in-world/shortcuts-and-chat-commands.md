# Shortcuts & Chat Commands

![](broken-reference)

## Keyboard Shortcuts

In addition to using the WASD or arrow keys to move your avatar around Decentraland, your keyboard can do a lot more for you when you're in-world. All the keyboard shortcuts are shown above. You can pull up this graphic in-world whenever you need it, just click the keyboard icon in the sidebar menu.

**Remember these shortcuts:**

* \[**B**]: Open Emote Wheel
* \[**Shift**]: Run while moving
* \[**C**]: Open Camera
* \[**K**]: Open Photo Gallery
* \[**U**]: Show/Hide UI
* \[**N**]: Show/Hide nametags

## Chat Commands

When you're in-world, you can always see a chat bar in the lower left corner of your screen. This is where you can access chats with your friends, as well as the **Nearby Chat**. Identifiable by the Decentraland icon, Nearby Chat is where you can chat freely with people around you in-world, even if you aren't friends. The Nearby Chat can also be used for entering Chat commands that only you will see.

Chat commands are specific strings of text used to trigger actions, such as teleporting or reloading. To use one, type the command in the Nearby Chat, and hit \[**Enter**].

* **Teleporting around Genesis City** `/goto x,y` (e.g. `/goto 0,0` for Genesis Plaza)
* **Visiting Worlds** `/goto World'sName` (e.g. `/goto officehours`)
* **Reloading a Scene** `/reload`
* **Open Debug Mode (shows FPS and other metrics)** `/debug`
* **Discover More Chat Commands** `/help`
