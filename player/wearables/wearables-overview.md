# Wearables Overview

![WearablesOverview](https://github.com/decentraland/docs-creator/blob/main/images/wearables-and-emotes/wearables-overview/00_wearables_overview.png)

## What Are Wearables?

Wearables are the various items of clothing, accessories, and body features that can be used to customize the appearance of a Decentraland avatar. There is a selection of default wearables that are freely available to all avatars, but Decentraland also supports the creation and use of custom wearables that are represented by non-fungible tokens (or NFTs). This allows a finite amount of different wearables to be created, or minted, on the blockchain, similar to the LAND.

There’s a growing range of available wearables including cyberpunk themed sneakers, fashionable jackets, fun top hats, and more! All of these stylistic choices give users an exciting and meaningful way to invest in, and express, their own unique personalities. By allowing wearables to be minted, and then sold, as NFTs, Decentraland provides content creators with a fun way to monetize their creative work.

By default, Decentraland Wearables are minted on the Polygon/Matic side-chain so users can mint, buy, sell, or transfer items without having to pay gas fees.

## What Are Smart Wearables?

Smart wearables are portable experiences that are turned on when the player puts on a certain item of clothing. Smart wearables can grant players new abilities, like a jetpack that lets them fly, or add a new layer of content on top of the rest of the world, like randomly placing coins to be collected throughout the whole of genesis city.

To know how to create **Smart Wearables** you can follow these [guidelines.](https://docs.decentraland.org/creator/development-guide/sdk7/smart-wearables/)

{% hint style="warning" %}
Smart wearables, as a subset of wearables, possess the capability to integrate advanced interactions and functionalities. Consequently, proficient skills in coding are necessary to unlock their full potential and enhance their features.

## Wearable Categories

Each wearable has a specific category that determines which body part in the avatar system (e.g. head, upper body, etc.) the wearable will be applied to. Certain wearables will impact whether or not other wearables are rendered, depending on the specific category. See the list below for details.

The different categories are:

![](https://github.com/decentraland/docs-creator/blob/main/images/wearables-and-emotes/creating-wearables/47_base_categories.png)

* **Skin:** Replaces the entire avatar (head, upper body, lower body and feet except accessories)
* **Head:**
  * **Mouth**
  * **Eyes**
  * **Eyebrows**
  * **Facial Hair**
  * **Hair**
* **Upper Body**
* **Lower Body**
* **Handwear**
* **Feet**

There are also accessories that can be applied to different areas of an avatar. Some of these accessories can impact other wearables. The accessories are:

* **Mask**
* **Eyewear**
* **Earring**
* **Tiara**
* **Top Head**
* **Hat**
* **Helmet**

For a detailed description of each category, and how items within each category interact or hide one another, see **\[Creating Wearables]\(\{{< ref "/content/creator/wearables-and-emotes/wearables/creating-wearables.md" >\}})**.

You can check some of the basic wearables here:

\
&#x20; const profile = Math.ceil(Math.random() \* 120)\
document.getElementById("emote-preview").src = "https://wearable-preview.decentraland.org/?profile=default"+profile+"\&transparentBackground\&loop=true"\
\
&#x20; function changeProfile() {\
document.getElementById("emote-preview").contentWindow.postMessage({\
&#x20; type: 'update',\
&#x20; payload: { options: {\
&#x20;   profile: \`default${Math.ceil(Math.random() \* 120)}\`\
&#x20; } }\
},'\*')\
return false\
&#x20; }
