# Backend Services

This page provides a comprehensive overview of all Decentraland backend services, their architectural roles, and how they interact within the ecosystem. For detailed API specifications and endpoints, refer to the [API Reference](../../apis/README.md) section.

## Service Architecture

Decentraland's backend is composed of distributed microservices organized into logical layers:

* **Decentralized Layer** - Catalyst network and content delivery infrastructure
* **Real-Time Communications Layer** - Service discovery and peer-to-peer communications
* **Feature Services** - User-facing functionality (content, economy, gamification)
* **Core Services** - Essential platform infrastructure (auth, marketplace, notifications)

***

## Decentralized Layer

### Catalyst

**Purpose**: Decentralized content delivery network

The Catalyst network forms the foundation of Decentraland's content infrastructure. Each Catalyst node is a complete server that provides:

* **Content Server** - Entity storage and retrieval (scenes, profiles, wearables)
* **Lambdas Service** - Utility endpoints and content queries
* **Communications Server** - Real-time message transport

**Architecture Role**: Catalyst nodes are geographically distributed and permissionless. The network provides content redundancy and availability without central control.

**Key Integrations**:
* Realm Provider - Advertises node availability
* Asset Bundle Registry - Triggers asset optimization on deployment
* Archipelago Workers - Provides island/cluster data

**API Reference**: [Catalyst API](../../apis/catalyst/overview)

### Lamb2

**Purpose**: Lambda utilities and serverless functions

Lamb2 provides utility endpoints for content consumption and queries that complement the Content Server:

* Scene aggregation and filtering
* Profile queries with fallbacks
* Status and health checks

**Architecture Role**: Acts as a convenience layer over the Content Server's raw entity access, providing higher-level query patterns commonly needed by clients.

**API Reference**: [Lamb2 API](../../apis/lamb2/overview)

***

## Real-Time Communications Layer

### Realm Provider

**Purpose**: Service discovery and realm selection

The Realm Provider is the entry point for all Decentraland clients. It implements intelligent realm selection based on:

* **Geographic optimization** - Routes users to nearest Catalyst nodes
* **Health monitoring** - Filters unhealthy or overloaded nodes
* **Capacity tracking** - Provides real-time user counts per realm
* **Hot scenes aggregation** - Identifies popular locations across all realms

**Architecture Role**: Single source of truth for available infrastructure. Clients query it once on startup to discover all service endpoints (Catalyst, Comms, BFF).

**Key Integrations**:
* Polls all Catalyst nodes periodically
* Aggregates Archipelago statistics
* Provides unified view of distributed network

**API Reference**: [Realm Provider API](../../apis/realm-provider/overview)

### Comms Gatekeeper

**Purpose**: Voice and video access control

The Gatekeeper manages access to LiveKit media servers for voice and video chat:

* **Token generation** - Creates time-limited access tokens with specific permissions
* **Scene administration** - Manages scene admin rights and banning
* **Stream management** - Controls live streaming access and RTMP keys
* **Privacy controls** - Enforces private voice chat permissions

**Architecture Role**: Security layer between clients and media infrastructure. Prevents unauthorized access while enabling flexible permission models (scene-based, private, community).

**Key Integrations**:
* LiveKit - Issues JWT tokens for media server access
* Worlds API - Validates world ownership for admin rights
* Signed Fetch - Authenticates all requests via wallet signatures

**API Reference**: [Comms Gatekeeper API](../../apis/comms-gatekeeper/overview)

### Archipelago Workers

**Purpose**: Communications clustering and message routing

Archipelago implements the proximity-based clustering protocol that groups nearby players into "islands":

* **WebSocket transport** - Maintains persistent connections with clients
* **Position tracking** - Monitors player locations in real-time
* **Island formation** - Dynamically groups players based on distance
* **Message routing** - Forwards messages only to island members

**Architecture Components**:
* **WebSocket Connector** - Handles client connections and authentication
* **Archipelago Core** - Implements clustering algorithm and island management
* **Stats Service** - Provides connection metrics and user counts
* **NATS Integration** - Publishes position updates and routes messages

**Architecture Role**: Optimizes peer-to-peer communications by limiting message fanout. Instead of broadcasting to all users in a realm, messages only reach players within interaction range.

**Key Integrations**:
* NATS message broker - Distributed message routing
* Realm Provider - Provides island statistics
* Places API - User count data for hot scenes

**API Reference**: [Archipelago Workers API](../../apis/archipelago-workers/overview)

* **Private Worlds** - NFT-gated access control
* **World Permissions** - Owner-managed admin and deployment rights

**Architecture Role**: Extends Decentraland's content model beyond the fixed LAND grid. Each world is a standalone scene with its own communication channels and access control.

**Key Integrations**:

## Service Interaction Patterns

### Common Integration Patterns

#### Catalyst Client Library

Many backend services use the **Catalyst Client** library to interact with the decentralized Catalyst network:

* **Social Service** - Fetches user profile data
* **Events API** - Queries scene metadata
* **Places** - Aggregates scene information
* **Asset Bundle Registry** - Listens for deployment events

This library abstracts away multi-node querying and failover logic.

#### NATS Message Broker

Real-time updates and asynchronous communication flow through NATS:

* **Social Service** - Publishes friend status changes
* **Worlds** - Broadcasts world configuration updates
* **Archipelago** - Routes position updates between islands
* **Events Notifier** - Publishes platform events

NATS enables services to communicate without direct coupling.

#### Blockchain Indexers

Services query indexers (not blockchain directly) for performance:

* **Worlds** - Verifies NAME NFT ownership
* **Atlas** - Fetches LAND parcel data
* **Credits Server** - Checks token balances
* **Rewards API** - Verifies eligibility conditions

Direct blockchain queries would be too slow for real-time APIs.

### Content Deployment Pipeline

When a user deploys content to Catalyst, multiple downstream services process it:

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    Deploy[User Deploys Content]
    Catalyst[Catalyst Node]
    Queue[Deployment Queue]
    
    subgraph Processing
        AB[Asset Bundle Converter]
        Profile[Profile Image Generator]
        Badges[Badges Processor]
        Events[Events Notifier]
    end
    
    Deploy --> Catalyst
    Catalyst --> Queue
    Queue --> AB
    Queue --> Profile
    Queue --> Events
    Events --> Badges
```

**Pipeline Steps**:

1. **Catalyst** - Stores raw entity data
2. **Deployment Queue** - Triggers async processing
3. **Asset Bundle Converter** - Builds optimized Unity bundles
4. **Profile Image Generator** - Renders avatar thumbnails (for profile entities)
5. **Events Notifier** - Publishes deployment event
6. **Badges Processor** - Checks for deployment achievement badges
