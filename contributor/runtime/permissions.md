When scenes require access to sensitive functionality, they must:

1. Declare the relevant [permissions in their manifest](..//contributor/content/entity-types/scenes.md#permissions).

3. Use the [RestrictedActions](../modules/restricted_actions.md) module to have the runtime perform the action (if authorized).

See those pages for more detailed information.
