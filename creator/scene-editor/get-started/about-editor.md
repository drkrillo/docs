# Editing Scenes

The Creator Hub includes a powerful Scene Editor that combines a simple no-code interface with the ability to write code to customize your scenes further.

See [Creator Hub Installation](editor-installation.md) to get started.

## Create a scene

To create a new scene, open the Creator Hub and press the _Create scene_ button.

You can then select what template to use as a starting point. You can pick a blank scene or a project with some initial content.

Then you'll be asked to name your scene, and choose a location to save it.

See [Manage scenes](manage-scenes.md) for more details.

## Moving around

To find your way around the Scene Editor:

* Use **A** and **W** to move close or far. You can also use the mouse scroll wheel, or **+** and **-** keys
* Use **S** and **D** to move sideways.
* Use **Q** and **E** to move up and down.
* Use the **Left Mouse Button** to click and select items and to move them around.
* Use the **Right Mouse Button** and drag to rotate the camera.

{% hint style="info" %}
**💡 Tip**: You can also rotate the camera by pressing **Alt** on Windows, or **Option** on Mac while dragging. This is especially handy when using a trackpad instead of a mouse.
{% endhint %}

* Press **Space bar** to reset the camera back to the default position

## Add items

Navigate the themed asset pack categories on the menu on the bottom to find different items that you can place on your scene.

To place an item, click and drag it in from the asset pack menu into a location on your scene in the canvas.

Click and drag a selected item to move it freely around the scene at ground level. See [Scene editor essentials](scene-editor-essentials.md#position-items) for more details.

{% hint style="info" %}
**💡 Tip**: Some items are **Smart items**, these come with built-in interactive behaviors. See [Smart items](../interactivity/smart-items.md) for more details.
{% endhint %}

## Preview

To test your scene and experience it like a player, click the _Preview_ button on the top-right corner. This will open a new window with the Decentraland Desktop Explorer, running just your scene. There you can move around the scene and interact with interactive items.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**📔 Note**: If you don't have it installed on your machine, download the **Decentraland Launcher** from [Decentraland.org](https://decentraland.org).
{% endhint %}

![](../../.gitbook/assets/preview-button.png)

Configure different preview options from the dropdown menu next to the **Preview** button:

* **Open Console Window During Preview**: Opens a new window with the console output of the scene. This is useful to debug errors in the scene.
* **Skip Auth Screen**: Skips the account selection screen and automatically logs you in with your currently logged in account. This is disabled by default, enable it if you want to test multiple accounts.
* **Landscape Terrain Enabled**: Toggles the landscape around the scene. This is enabled by default, disable it to lower the scene's memory footprint.

## Scene settings

Click the **Pencil icon** on the top-right of the screen. This opens a series of scene-level properties to edit, including name, thumbnail, scene size, and more.

See [Scene Settings](../configure/scene-settings.md) for more details.

## Publish your scene

Once you're happy with your scene, press _Publish scene_.

See [Publish scene](../publish/publish-scene.md) for more details.
