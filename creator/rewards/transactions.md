# Transactions

The "transactions" tab in the Rewards service allows creators to monitor the status of the transactions that are being processed by the Rewards service showing the status of each transaction, its hash, the moment it was created, and the amount of _Gwei_ spent.

For each transaction you can click on the **View claims** button to see the list of wearables/emotes minted on that transaction and what user received them.
