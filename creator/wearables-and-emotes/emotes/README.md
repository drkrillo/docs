# Emotes Overview

You can preview emotes using the [Emote Preview Tool](https://wearable-preview.decentraland.org/?profile=default1&emote=dance&transparentBackground&loop=true).

Emotes are animation sequences for avatars' skeleton bones, which are defined in a transport file, usually in `.glb`, or `.gltf` formats. An emote can include sound, or even an animated 3d geometry attached to it. For more information check [Adding Props and Sounds to your Emotes](props-and-sounds.md).

There are a selection of free default Emotes that are available to any user, but Decentraland also supports the creation and use of custom Emotes that are represented by non-fungible tokens ( NFTs). This allows a finite amount of different Emotes to be created, or minted, on the blockchain, similar to **[Wearables](../wearables-and-emotes/wearables/wearables-overview.md)**.

By default, Decentraland Emotes are minted on the Polygon/Matic sidechain so users can mint, buy, sell, or transfer items without having to pay gas fees (the DAO covers these costs as voted on in [**this Proposal**](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=548aa0c0-d51a-11ec-b521-2f98ffa6ccb0)).

Emotes are organized into different categories depending on what a Creator thinks best describes what an Emote does. The available categories are:

* Dance
* Stunt
* Greetings
* Fun
* Poses
* Reactions
* Horror
* Miscellaneous
