# Worlds

Decentraland Worlds are your own personal 3D space in the Decentraland ecosystem, separate from Genesis City's map of LAND parcels. A World can be kept private or shared with anyone with just a link. Able to host up to 100 concurrent users, you can use your World to host events, display your work, or as a blank canvas where you can unleash your creativity and experiment.

## What are Worlds?

Worlds are personal 3D spaces located beyond the boundaries of Genesis City. Worlds can serve various purposes, such as:

* Hosting events
* Unleashing your creativity
* Building new experiences
* Hosting a portfolio of scenes
* Testing scenes before deploying them to Genesis City

## Getting Started

To get your own Decentraland World, you need a [Decentraland NAME](https://builder.decentraland.org/names) (costs 100 MANA) or an [ENS domain](https://ens.domains). These NAMEs are then used by the Decentraland Explorer to load the associated World.
